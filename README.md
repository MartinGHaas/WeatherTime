### Status: 🟡 - in development
#### Languages: HTML, CSS and JS
#### APIs: OpenWeather _(free license)_

> ## Extra note:
> - The free openWeather license does not grant access to the daily maximum and minimum temperatures. Therefore, we take it every three hours in a day. Therefore, there is a high chance that the daily max and lows are wrong. If there is any other API that catches the max and min temps, please let me know ;)
